value is where you are.

anti-capitalist//capitalism. anti-art//art. anti-curated//curation.<br>
found material art confronts our value judgements /// insisting meaning is where you are.<br>
it is not a question of if<br>
if it is worth it<br>
the question is if you can see why it is<br>
————————————[without speaking]<br>
</p>
<p>
any particular piece of art is not the point. the point is to learn seeing meaning in everything everywhere unrelentingly<br>
not because skill<br>
but because human<br>
because all of it<br>
is the universe<br>
and us
</p>
<p>
let it see you or not<br>
all the same. the artist and taoist insist<br>
so we say see it<br>
why not?<br>
